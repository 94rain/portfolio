    title: 'Fail through the Cracks: Cross-System Interaction Failures in Modern Cloud Systems',
    description: `This work presents an emerging failure mode, cross-system interaction (CSI) failures, and its first in-depth analysis from public cloud and widely co-deployed open-source systems. We discussed approaches to investigate for cross-system testing and analysis. As a feasibility study, we developed a data-plane cross-system testing tool for Spark and Hive, and it exposed 15 discrepancies between interacting systems, of which 9 have been acknowledged by developers. This work has been recognized and accepted at Eurosys'23 conference.`,
