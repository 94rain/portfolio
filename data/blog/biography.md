Hello, my name is Shuyang Ji. I am a junior studying [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-mathematics-computer-science) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), expecting to graduate in May 2023.

## Career interests

My interests broadly lie in the field of Systems and networking, Software Engineering and Programming languages. Recently I have been working on IoT virtualization, supervised by [Prof. Matthew Caesar](https://caesar.web.engr.illinois.edu/).

I am passionate about building building blocks for software system and programming programs that program other programs. And I plan to work in the field of computer systems and networking. 

**Industry or academia? **

This is a tough question. An overwhelming majority of students would end up in industry and likely so will I. I am pretty much leaning toward industry and I have been seeking industrial opportunities for Summer 2022. And I will most likely NOT to pursue postgraduate study right after graduation.

## Involvement
I serve as a SysOp at MediaWiki.org and a global rollbacker on all wikimedia projects (See [my homepage](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:94rain) and [CentralAuth](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAuth/94rain)). These are just fancy ways to say that the community has given me some extra buttons to help with uncontroversial maintenance.
