Hello, my name is Shuyang Ji. I am a senior undergraduate student studying [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-mathematics-computer-science) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I expect to graduate in either August or December 2023.

## Career interests

I am on the job market! I am actively seeking opportunities in software engineering, infrastructure, and systems research and development.

I am a system and networking enthusiast with a passion for building and revamping systems to achieve greater resilience. I am currently studying streaming processing and observability.



## Previous experience

During the Spring 2023 semester, I am participating in the [Engineering City Scholars Program](https://cityscholars.engineering.illinois.edu/) and interning at [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com/) to contribute to the feature alignment service cloud re-architecture for the [Unimap](https://www.here.com/about/press-releases/en/here-introduces-unimap-to-revolutionize-how-maps-are-created-updated-and), an emerging revolutionary and automated location platform. For the upcoming Summer, I will intern at [Splunk](https://www.Splunk.com/) working on stream processing and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). See you in the Bay Area!

During the summer of 2022, I worked at [Ploomber](https://github.com/ploomber), a [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) backed startup, where I worked on building a framework and cloud services to make it easier for data scientists to build data pipelines.

Before leaning more towards an industry career, I had the luck to spend some time exploring systems research, in topics including IoT virtualization, software testing, system reliability and storage systems.


## Involvement
I serve as a SysOp at MediaWiki.org and a global rollbacker on all wikimedia projects (See [my homepage](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:94rain) and [CentralAuth](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAuth/94rain)). These are just fancy ways to say that the community has given me some extra buttons to help with uncontroversial maintenance.
